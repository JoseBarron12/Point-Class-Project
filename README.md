# Find Program

## Overview

Welcome to the Find Program! This C++ program is designed to search for a character or string within another string. The program provides a user-friendly interface for inputting a sentence and the desired character or string to find, then displays the results.

## Features

- **Character Search:**
  - Displays the position(s) of a character in the sentence.

- **String Search:**
  - Indicates whether the specified string is present in the sentence and displays its position.

- **Multiple Occurrences:**
  - For character searches, the program can display multiple locations if the character appears more than once.

## Test Runs

The program has undergone rigorous testing to ensure its correct functionality. Various test cases cover different scenarios, showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented operator overloads.

1. **Coordinate Input and Output:**
   - User enters x and y coordinates for two points, and the program displays the entered points.

2. **Midpoint Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the midpoint between the entered points using the overloaded division operator.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The distance between the entered points is computed using the overloaded subtraction operator.

4. **Equality Check:**
   - The program checks if the entered points are equal using the overloaded equality operator.

5. **Inequality Check:**
   - The program checks if the entered points are not equal using the overloaded inequality operator.

6. **Coordinate Indexing:**
   - User inputs new x and y coordinates for a point and retrieves individual coordinates using the overloaded indexing operator.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is located in the accompanying PDF file named `Barron-Jose-PointClass.pdf`. The document is structured to be read from left to right, providing a detailed explanation of the code, 
its functions, and the rationale behind design decisions.

All the source code for this project is organized into three main files:

- `point.h`: Header file defining the `Point` class, including declarations for member functions and overloaded operators.

- `point.cpp`: Implementation file containing the definitions for the member functions of the `Point` class and the implementation of overloaded operators.

- `p.cpp`: Main program file where the user interacts with the program. It includes the `main` function, which demonstrates the usage of the `Point` class and tests the overloaded operators.

## Skills Showcase

This project showcases proficiency in various key areas:

- **C++ Programming:**
  - Utilizes C++ language features to implement and demonstrate operator overloading in the `Point` class.
  - Demonstrates understanding of object-oriented principles, including encapsulation and abstraction.

- **Problem Solving:**
  - Addresses the challenge of enhancing a given `Point` class with operator overloading for different operations.
  - Implements solutions for mathematical computations, input/output handling, and logic related to points in a 2D space.

- **Documentation:**
  - The accompanying PDF provides clear and detailed documentation, explaining the code's functionality, usage, and design choices.

- **Testing:**
  - Demonstrates thorough testing with various scenarios to ensure the correctness and reliability of the overloaded operators.
  - Test cases cover equality/inequality, distance calculation, coordinate manipulation, and input/output operations.

- **File Organization:**
  - Adheres to a structured file organization with separate header (`point.h`) and implementation (`point.cpp`) files.
  - Encapsulates related functionality into a class, promoting modularity and maintainability.

These skills collectively showcase the ability to design, implement, and document a C++ program that leverages key language features and addresses specific problem domains.
